Unistore Creator is a simple program created in "Visual Basic 6.0 Professional Edition" that can create
a .unistore file that can be used in Universal Updater.

For now it is very basic (it only supports .cia files) and it's likely 
that in the future it will stop working in more recent versions of the universal updater
